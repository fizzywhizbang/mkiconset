# mkiconset
A script to create icns file on MacOS for inclusion in a program you'll need an original file at 1024px  
and of course MacOS

## directions  
either put the script in your path or in the directory you want to work in   
if in the path just run mkiconset.sh and answer two questions  
if in the target directory then run ./mkiconset.sh  
Supply iconset name:MYICON
Starting ICON (should be 1024 in size):ICON.png  
The script will create a directory with the iconset name above eg. MYICON.iconset  
Then the script will create a file with the name eg. MYICON.icns  
  
That's it easy peasy
